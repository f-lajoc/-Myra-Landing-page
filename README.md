## My process

### Built with

- Css Animaion
- Bootstrap
- Flexbox
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow


### Thoughts and Troubles
- coding with phone is stressful but i like the outcome of this project, getting a PC is my priority now

- i wanted to make card slider at the company products section but bootstrap carousel wasn't working and i didn't want to choose from scratch, I'll try it in my next project

- The search icon was supposed to be at the front of the hamburger menu but it wasn't working since i used bootstrap for the nav menu,i guess there should be a way around it, anyways i decided to change the position

- There is space at the top of the page which i couldn't seem to remove, i think it might be due to the bootstrap navigation 

- The embed site is bringing an error anytime i check the site ...i have no idea how to stop it iho

### What I learned and used

- I used bootstrap for the navigation, the button and input text, using css library is easy

- using illustration images makes the site popout more

- I'm getting better at manipulating flex

- I want to use another hosting site like vercel, netlifu

- First time I'll embed a site in another

I used 

- embed to add a site within a card
- animation generator for my animations 

### Continued development

I should learn Tailwind CSS as recommended in place of bootstrap 
- Keep practicing Flex
- Grid
- Transition
- Animation
- Responsiveness 

### Useful resources
